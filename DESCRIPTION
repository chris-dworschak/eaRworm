Description: A toy package to play audio of "Merry Christmas" or "Happy Birthday" using R. Functionality includes a small number of arrangements that slightly deviate from the standard song versions. I developed this toy package in Christmas spirit; it will not be submitted to CRAN. The package status is "experimental" because successful use is dependent on the operating system and a pre-installed WAV audio player.
